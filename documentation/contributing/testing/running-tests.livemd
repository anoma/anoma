## Intent

This document is aimed at allowing any developer to run tests in a more ergonomic way than simply running:

```shell
% mix test
```

Namely, this document covers running tests inside `IEX` and being able to do so on demand.

## Setting up IEX

To Run tests within IEx. One simply calls `&Mix.Tasks.Test.run/1` within their IEX session.

However attempting to do this by default will result in the following error:

```shell
 iex --sname mariari --cookie mariari -S mix
```

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
Mix.Tasks.Test.run([])
```

````
** (Mix.Error) "mix test" is running in the "dev" environment. If you are running tests from within another command, you can either:

  1. set MIX_ENV explicitly:

      MIX_ENV=test mix test.another

  2. set the :preferred_envs for "def cli" in your mix.exs:

      def cli do
        [preferred_envs: ["test.another": :test]]
      end

    (mix 1.15.5) lib/mix.ex:577: Mix.raise/2
    (mix 1.15.5) lib/mix/tasks/test.ex:486: Mix.Tasks.Test.do_run/3
    #cell:nsl6gqly4w45ei6b:1: (file)
    ```
````

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

The error text hints at a suggestion on how to solve the problem.

```shell
MIX_ENV=iex iex --sname mariari --cookie mariari -S mix
```

I recommend using the `iex` environment over the `test` environment that is shwon in the error, as in the `Anoma` project, we set the `test` environment to have `Config.config/2` to have the following settings:

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
config :logger,
  level: :error
```

Which means that some logging details you may care about may not be reported to you by default.

Now that we have the environment setup if we try running this again we get:

```elixir
Mix.Tasks.Test.run([])
```

<!-- livebook:{"output":true} -->

```

Finished in 0.00 seconds (0.00s async, 0.00s sync)
0 failures

Randomized with seed 670138
```

<!-- livebook:{"output":true} -->

```
:ok
```

Running the command has a few effects:

1. It behaves the same as `mix test` running every single test in the project.
2. It loads in the test modules, meaning we now have access to all modules in `AnomaTest`.
3. `ExUnit` is now started up, meaning we can run tests with `ExUnit.run/0` now.

For larger projects `1.` may be prohibitive as tests may take quite a while to run!

## Running Individual Modules For the First Time

To run an individual module, one simply needs to invoke the `ExUnit` framework themselves.

A good example of this at play is the following example:

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
iex(mariari@YU-NO)1> ExUnit.start
:ok
iex(mariari@YU-NO)2> c "test/node/mempool_test.exs"
[AnomaTest.Node.Mempool]
iex(mariari@YU-NO)3> ExUnit.run

14:46:45.846 [error] Worker failed! :error

14:46:45.849 [error] Worker failed! :error
.....
Finished in 0.3 seconds (0.3s async, 0.00s sync)
5 tests, 0 failures

Randomized with seed 670138
%{total: 5, failures: 0, excluded: 0, skipped: 0}
```

We can see here that I've started up ExUnit with `ExUnit.start/0`, then I've manually compiled the module I wanted to run `c ...` and then I ran `ExUnit.run/0`.

The side effect of running tests this way is that only `AnomaTest.Node.Mempool` is in scope. The other tests are not.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

The behavior of `ExUnit.run/0` is quite configurable, see `ExUnit.configure/1` for a lot of options on filtering what tests are run.

## ReRunning Tests

One may be surprised at the first time they try to rerun tests, as they will run into the following anomaly:

```elixir
Mix.Tasks.Test.run([])
```

<!-- livebook:{"output":true} -->

```

Finished in 0.00 seconds (0.00s async, 0.00s sync)
0 failures

Randomized with seed 670138
```

<!-- livebook:{"output":true} -->

```
:ok
```

No tests were run again! This can be rather annoying as we often make changes to code and wish to see if they break certain tests!

A way around this is by recompiling the given module then running again

```iex
iex 7> r AnomaTest.Node.Mempool
warning: redefining module AnomaTest.Node.Mempool (current version defined in memory)
  test/node/mempool_test.exs:1: AnomaTest.Node.Mempool (module)

{:reloaded, [AnomaTest.Node.Mempool]}
iex(mariari@YU-NO)8> Mix.Tasks.Test.run([])

14:58:09.255 [error] Worker failed! :error

14:58:09.256 [error] Worker failed! :error
.....
Finished in 0.3 seconds (0.3s async, 0.00s sync)
5 tests, 0 failures
```

## Running individual tests

Since most (if not all!) tests are composed from examples. One can simply run the examples directly!

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

If we take `AnomaTest.LiveBook.Example` as our example, then we can run the individual tests like the following.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

Test names are odd in that they are not simple atoms, they are typically the word `test` then the string name given to the test. Hence `test "first"` became `AnomaTest.LiveBook.Example."test first"/1`.

To run the group, we need to prepend the group name as well.

## Conclusion

Running tests in Elixir is nice and somewhat simple!

We have covered how to:

1. Run tests within `IEX`
2. re-running tests in `IEX`
3. running individual tests fully
4. Running individual tests partially
