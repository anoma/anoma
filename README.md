# Anoma

This is an implementation of the Anoma protocol, whose specs can be
found [here](https://specs.anoma.net/latest).

## Following Development

Work is merged into `base` on a bi-weekly (once every two weeks)
schedule.

Development can be followed in multiple ways:

1. [Issues are put into the project overview](https://github.com/orgs/anoma/projects/19)
   - This is a good way to see what work is assigned and the various
     views into how goals are being met
2. [What's Cooking on Anoma](https://github.com/orgs/anoma/projects/20 "A good view on how topics are progressing throughout a cycle")
3. [Research Forums](https://research.anoma.net/)
   - This is good for seeing discussions on the direction of Anoma
   - [The architecture posts](https://research.anoma.net/tags/c/protocol-design/25/architecture)
     in particular are a practical vision for how the codebase's
     architecture will evolve. Around two of these get posted per week
4. [Issues](https://github.com/anoma/anoma/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/anoma/anoma/pulls)
   - This is good for viewing new issues and work coming in, but the
     other views are typically a better way to view this

## Running pre-built binaries
### Release Dependencies
To run a working Anoma Node the following dependencies are required:

1. Mac OS X Development Environment:
    * Install Apple Command Line Developer Tools: `xcode-select --install`
    * Install [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/install.php) (or equivalent package manager)
2. Install [ncurses](https://ports.macports.org/port/ncurses/) (Mac OS X only)
3. Install OpenSSL:
    * Mac OS X and Linux: use package manager
    * Windows: not required
### Running
Download the [Anoma release](https://github.com/anoma/anoma/releases) for your platform, extract it, and run `bin/anoma`.
## Compilation from sources
### Build Dependencies

To compile a working Anoma Node the following dependencies are required:

1. Mac OS X Development Environment:
    * Install Apple Command Line Developer Tools: `xcode-select --install`
    * Install [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/install.php) (or equivalent package manager)
2. Windows Development Environment:
    * Install [Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) (Workload: Visual C++ build tools)
    * Install [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.4)
3. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) (Windows and Linux only)
4. Install CMake:
    * Linux and Mac OS X: use package manager
    * Windows: not required
5. Install [Sodium](https://doc.libsodium.org/installation#pre-built-libraries) (Windows only)
    * Ensure that the `LIB` and `INCLUDE` environment variables point to this installation
6. Install [Protocol Buffers](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/)
    * Note: the default protobuf in aptitude is very outdated. Be sure to install it manually.
7. Install [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) (version 1.17.0 or higher) and with it:
     * Install [Hex package manager](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/1.13/Mix.Tasks.Local.Hex.html)
     * Install [Rebar3](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/1.14/Mix.Tasks.Local.Rebar.html)
     * Install protobuf-elixir: `mix escript.install hex protobuf`
8. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (version 1.76.0 or newer)

### Compiling and Running

To install the dependencies as well as Anoma run:

```bash
mix deps.get
mix escript.install hex protobuf
mix compile
```

To start an Anoma instance run one of these:

```bash
iex -S mix # starts an interactive shell
mix run --no-halt # starts a non-interactive shell
```

See the Contributing section for how to get the best use of the
interactive shell.

Further see the Known issues section if you encounter an issue.


## Docker images
To work with Docker images, do the following:
1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), this is necessary for both building and running Docker images
2. Build the Anoma image from the repository root: `docker build -t <IMAGE> .`
    * `<IMAGE>` is your chosen image name
4. Run the Anoma image: `docker run -it --network host <IMAGE> <SUBCOMMAND>`
    * `<IMAGE>` is the name of Anoma Docker image to be run
    * `<SUBCOMMAND>`is interpreted by the Anoma binary
    * `--network host` will enable connections from the host

## Contributing

Please read the [contributor's guide](./documentation/contributing.livemd) for in
depth details about the codebase.

## Known Issues

### (Mix) Could not compile dependency :enacl

For some versions of OSX (and Linux), our
[enacl](https://github.com/jlouis/enacl) package may have compilation issues.

To get around it please run

```sh
git checkout mariari/no-libsodium
mix clean
mix deps.get
mix compile
```

### could not compile dependency :cairo, "mix compile"

The rust compiler can be quite picky about our
[cairo](https://github.com/anoma/aarm-cairo) dependencies. This is
likely caused by an incompatible rust-toolchain.

To get around it you may have to run a command like:

```sh
rustup toolchain add 1.76.0
# for OSX you may try 1.76.0-aarch64-apple-darwin
```

Once this is had, the Cairo issues should go away.

### Git

This codebase follows a git style similar to
[git](https://git-scm.com/) or
[linux](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git).

New code should be based on `base`, and no attempt to keep it up to
sync with `main` should be had. When one's topic is ready, just submit
a PR on github and a maintainer will handle any merge conflicts.

There are bi-weekly releases, so do not be afraid if a maintainer says
the PR is merged but it's still open, this just means that it's merged
into `next` or `main` and will be included in the next scheduled
release.

For more information on a smooth git experience check out the [git
section in contributor's guide](./documentation/contributing/git.livemd)

Happy hacking, and don't be afraid to submit patches.
