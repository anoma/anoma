defmodule EventBroker do
  @moduledoc """
  I am the EventBroker Application Module.

  I startup the PubSub system as an own OTP application. Moreover I provide
  all the API necessary for the use of the system. I contain all public
  functionality provided by the Broker and the Registry.

  ### Public API

  I have the following public functionality:

  - `event/1`
  - `subscribe_me/1`
  - `unsubscribe_me/1`
  - `subscribe/2`
  - `unsubscribe/2`

  ## Overview

  The EventBroker manages subscriptions for processes that are interested in a
  particular type of message.

  ### Filters

  Messages are defined as "filter specs" that define patterns an event must
  match in order for them to be sent. The filter below will subscribe to all
  events that are are maps with a key `:type` that has value `:error`.

  ```
  deffilter MyFilter do
    %{type: :error} -> true
    _ -> false
  end
  ```

  Filters can be composed by creating a "filter spec list". If a process is
  interested in all `MyFilter` events, but only those whose `message` field is
  `nil`, a second filter can be used to refine the filter.

  ```
  deffilter MyFilterNil do
    %{message: nil} -> true
    _ -> false
  end

  ```

  ### Subscribing to events

  To subscribe to all messages that match the `MyFilter` the subscribing process
  must call `&EventBroker.subscribe/1` with the filter spec list as argument.
  E.g., `EventBroker.subscribe([MyFilter])`. To only subscribe to events that
  also have `nil` for the `:message` value, the filter spec list should include
  the `MyFilterNil` filter. E.g., `EventBroker.subscribe([MyFilter,
  MyFilterNil])`.

  If a particular filter is no longer of intrest, `EventBroker.unsubscribe/1`
  can be used to unsubscribe from a filter.

  ### Sending events

  Any process can generate an event using the `&EventBroker.event/1` function.

  ```
  EventBroker.event(%{type: :error, message: "something happened"})
  ```

  I am the subscription function.

  Given a PID and a list of filter specs, I ensure that all the actors
  corresponding to each spec given in the list is launched and subscribed
  to each other in the appropriate order - e.g. given `[spec1, spec2]` I
  ensure that agents implemented `spec1` and `spec2` are launched and that
  the former is subscribed to the top broker, while the latter is subscribed
  to the former.

  I also do this in a minimal fashion, that is, if some starting subchain of
  filter spec dependency has already been registered, I launch the minimal
  chain remaining to build the full dependency.

  Note that each filter actor is hence not only determined by the filtering
  functionality it has but also on the chain of dependencies it is spawned
  with. Hence `[spec1, spec2]` corresponds to an agent different from
  `[spec2]`.

  Afterwards, I subscribe the given PID to the final filter agent in the
  dependency chain and register all the new agents in the map by putting
  the filter agent PIDs as values to their dependency filter specification.

  If I notice that any of the filter structures do not have an appropriate
  public filter functionality exposed, I return the list of such modules
  back to the user and do nothing with respect to agent-spawning or
  registration.

  Filter Agent spawning is handled via DynamicSupervisor.

  Given a PID and a list of filter specs, I get the PID of the related

  base state.

  Otherwise, it will shut down, prompting to recursively send unsubscription
  requests to its parent filters and processing their termination
  appropriately in a synchronous manner.

  After all the requests have been sent and terminations recorded, I remove
  all agents which have shut down from my registry map and return `:ok`
