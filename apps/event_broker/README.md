I am the EventBroker application. I contain an implemenentation of a
general PubSub system using the notion of filters.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `event_broker` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:event_broker, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
