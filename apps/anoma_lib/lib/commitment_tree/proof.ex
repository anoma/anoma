  # (ok, I do, but it involves mutation), but for elixir, represent this is as:
  # a path, which is the digit-reversed (in base splay) offset of the
  # commitment, and a proof, which is a nested tuple structure; it has splay
  # elements, all but one of which are binaries, and one of which is itself a
  # nested tuple, except at the bottom level
