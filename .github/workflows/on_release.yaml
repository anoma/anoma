# Release
#
# This is the pipeline that will run for every release.
# A release is a tag that starts with a "v" followed by a version number.
# In brief, pushing a tag will run this pipeline.
#
# The pipeline does the following.
# 0. Try to merge this release with next.
# 1. Compile the source code for all environments (dev, test, prod)
# 2. Run the linter on the source code.
# 3. Run the entire test suite
# 4. Compile the documentation
# 5. Make a release on GitHub
